# AABKoala
Automatic Audit Benchmarking Project with the Koala Team
Bacause of the data increament and increasing complexity of autdit data, a normal Excel table is not able to handle the audit process and data analysis conducted by ARPANSA. As a result, a database is urgently required. This project normalises the Excel data into a Mysql database schema and implemented a backend to automate the "IMRT" and "3DRT" analysis process.

An local program is also developed as a replacement of front-end to allow user to run the automated process.
