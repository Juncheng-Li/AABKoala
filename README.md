# AABKoala
Bacause of the increament of the audit data, a normal Excel table is not capable of handling the and increasingly complex audit process and data analysis conducted by the ARPANSA. As a result, a database is urgently required. This project normalises the Excel data into a Mysql database schema and implemented a backend to automate the "IMRT" and "3DRT" analysis process.

Additionally, an local program is developed as a substitution of front-end to allow user to run the automated process.
